# Food Delivery App Backend Code
This is the code I am currently writing for a class project. I'm proud of this particular project because it is my first exposure to backend programming. Two months ago I had never worked with databases, servers, cloud-based code, HTTP, Maven, or CI/CD. Now I have a functional server that accepts multiple HTTP requests from clients, and automatically compiles and runs as a service on a remote computer when I push my code. This may not be my best, or most complex code, but it shows my ability to learn and use new technology while maintaining high standards for my final product.

This project is still a work in progress, and I will be adding more classes and functions in the weeks to come.
